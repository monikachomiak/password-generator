# Title
Password generator Challenge

# Project Description

This challeneg requires that we create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

# Expected Behavior

When a user clicks the button to generate a password, they're presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

When prompted for password criteria, they select specific criteria such as length of the password, a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters, confirmation of any character types, and confirmation of whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters, 

When a prompt is answered, you select the ok button to continue. If you do not continue, a prompt will appear of "require value".

Once all prompts have been answered, a randomly generated password will appear.
